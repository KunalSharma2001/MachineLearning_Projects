# Email Spam Classifier
----------------------------------------------------------------

### SPAM MAIL:
Mails that are of no use to you. Mails that are residing in your inbox for no use and just eating up your drive space.
People get advertisement mails, promotional mails, and namy more.
Here our AIM is to develope a simple email smap classifier, that will classify emails the mail that whether the mail is Spam or Not Spam.

-> Here we will be classifying emails in two categories:

    1. Spam Mails : mails that are promotional, advertised or of no use.
    2. Ham Mails(Not Spam Mails): Mails which are not Spam and are of our use.
                                  It maybe a conversation, or a offer, or some workn related stuff.

`We'll be using Machine Learning get these predictions/classifications.
Here we will be using **Logistic Regression** to predict the outcome.`

Our Work FLor :
<h3> **Mail Data -> Data Pre-Processing -> Train & Test Data Split -> Logistic Regression Model** </h3>
